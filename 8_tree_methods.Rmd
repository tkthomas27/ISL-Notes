##Basics of Decision Trees

* Stratifying/segmenting predictor space into simple regions
* Useful and easy to interpret but not as powerful
* bagging, random forests, and boosting help
* Can be used for regression and classification

\subsection{Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting}

\subsection{Bagging}

Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) is a general purpose tool for reducing variance of statistical methods; frequently used with decision trees

\subsection{Random Forests}

decorrelates the tree

\subsection{Boosting}
